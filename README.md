- Checklist-based audit categories:
  - Attention
  - Trust
  - Clarity
  - CTA strength
  - Friction
  - Proof
- Weighted conversion readiness score

## Files

- `index.html` — Main UI and audit form structure
- `styles.css` — Responsive styles, cards, form layout, and radar chart design

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Enter business details and landing page information.
3. Select the checklist items that apply to the page.

- The audit is designed as a high-level landing page readiness tool, not a replacement for a full UX review.
